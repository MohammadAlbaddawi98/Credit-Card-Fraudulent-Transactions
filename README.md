## Introduction
In this case study, we will explore a fraud detection problem using a dataset containing information about credit card transactions. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or benign based on various features associated with each transaction.


## Objective

The main objective of this case study is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on the provided dataset.


## Evaluation Metric
The primary evaluation metric will be F1 score & ROC.

## Training the Model

Steps to train and validate the model are as follows:

### 1. Download the data

Start by downloading the data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Geix7dDaUWp7SVTOsomGZ5IQ566h1gcf?usp=sharing). 


### 2. Installing the dependencies

I have utilized plenty of libraries here which can easily been installed using the following command.

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Training the Model

Finally run the `fraud_detection.ipynb` file and the training and validation should begin.
